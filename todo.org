howdy emacs folks. i set up some erc auto login in scripts.  But I
don't necessarily want them to log in upon starting up the emacs
application.  How might I make the auto login dependant upon the
execution of the M-x "erc" command

<SerajewelKS> coltkirk: #1 rule is make a full system backup before
doing upgrades you’re worried about <coltkirk> using git right
<SerajewelKS> coltkirk: git is not a backup tool. i use restic,
there’s also things like duplicity and borg. [12:12] <SerajewelKS> (if
you use restic, the version in debian is so out of date that it’s
useless, use the release binary on github instead) <nkuttler> eh, rule
1# of backups is to automate them and make them continuously ;)
<SerajewelKS> that too <Hund> Rule #2 should probably be to test your
backups. :) <nkuttler> pretty much [12:13] <Hund> The only thing
that’s worse than no backups is backups that doesn’t work. <coltkirk>
ok. thank you. i save those type of rules into a todo.org file for me
to go through, and ‘learn by doing’ <coltkirk> my life is one lon todo
list <coltkirk> *long <nkuttler> the more you learn, the longer it
gets <Hund> There’s also that 3-2-1 rule as well. <Hund> 3 copies, 2
types of medias and 1 offsite copy. If I recall it correctly. [12:16]
<coltkirk> duly noted <SerajewelKS> with restic i keep one copy
on-site and two off-site copies instead [12:17] <SerajewelKS> seems a
bit safer to me <Hund> They’re talking about servers though. You don’t
store the backups on the server. So we’re really talking about 3
computers and one of them is offsite. [12:20] <SerajewelKS> right. we
use one on-site dedicated backup server and two off-site
replicas. [12:21] <Hund> Okey. :)
